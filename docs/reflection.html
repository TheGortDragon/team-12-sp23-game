            </div>
            <p>Overall, we felt that we did a good job for our first game development process within a team. We did
                realize the importance of utilizing a development log for tasks as we went in our own directions with
                the assigned tasks and leaning into our strengths. Some mistakes were, of course, also made and adjusted to
                fit the time given. Specifically, the implementation of unnecessary components in the early stages of
                our development, as well as components that were unused as the direction of our game shifted. Tasks were
                assigned as sprints on a Trello workboard to keep track of everyone's assigned tasks and were later
                formulated into the development log document to be more clearly structured.</p>

            <h2>As a team, one thing that we did really well with was our idea.</h2>
            <p>While there were some areas that could've been more fleshed out, such as the game world and the story,
                sticking to a smaller scoped game allowed us to get really creative as time went on. Since the player is
                so constrained, it allowed us to get creative with the level design and have progression. It also
                allowed us to add features mid-development, such as the leaderboard system.</p>

            <h2>If we had another 2 weeks to work on the game, our 3 highest priority items would be:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the pogo stick more fluid</li>
                <li>Improve enemy collisions with the player</li>
                <li>Rework our leaderboard system to use CORS to allow HTTP requests on WebGL</li>
            </ol>

            <p>All of these items reflect issues that players have had with our game or bugs that we have found from our
                own internal testing.</p>
